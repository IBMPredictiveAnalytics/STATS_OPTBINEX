# STATS OPTBINEX
## Construct optimal bins for a categorical or continuous target
 This command uses the TREE CHAID algorithm on a categorical or continuous target to group categories or ranges of predictor values that have statistically indistinguishable effects on the target.  It can carry out the transformations and save that syntax for future use.  It also provides value labels for the new variables.  Predictor variables are analyzed one at a time.  The results are similar to those from OPTIMAL BINNING for continuous variables and ADP, but has the advantage of exposing the transformations and providing labels.
